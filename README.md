This project showcases how to convert a desktop-only website into a fully responsive, mobile-friendly experience using HTML and CSS media queries. The main goal was to ensure that the layout adapts smoothly across different devices, especially on screens smaller than 768px (like smartphones and tablets).

By using flexible layouts, fluid images, and CSS media queries, the design intelligently responds to screen size changes. Elements like the navigation bar are transformed into a modern hamburger menu, and font sizes, padding, and layout structure adjust accordingly to fit smaller screens. Overflow issues are handled, and images scale properly inside their containers, making the UI clean and user-friendly.

This project improves your understanding of responsive design principles, mobile-first development, and how to build web pages that provide an optimal experience for users on any device â€” without relying on JavaScript frameworks or CSS libraries.
